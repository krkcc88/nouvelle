### Vendetta

(Van-det-a)  Translation - blood feud.  The enactment of a formal feud in a manner that complied with the Great Convention. It often resulted in an official war of attrition between two opponents.  Originally created as a way of allowing bitter disputes to be resolved without any harm being brought upon innocent bystanders. It was similar in many ways to the ancient duels, although it usually had much broader ramifications. This animosity may have continued from father to son, until the last child was dead or the two groups made peace.
