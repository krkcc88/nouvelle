Nouvelle, the new lands, where knights and nobles rule.  

  

The landscape of Nouvelle is vast and varied, featuring sprawling forests, rolling hills, and majestic mountains. The cities and towns of the land are bustling with activity, filled with merchants, craftsmen, and artisans, all vying for the attention of the wealthy nobles.

  

The capital of the duchy is La Pavillon-sous-Chênaie (La Pav-e-yon sue Shin-ey, a city known for its grand architecture, winding canals, and vibrant street life. The city is dominated by the towering spires of the cathedral of Sainte-Marie, a magnificent structure that houses some of the most valuable relics in the land. La Pavillon is also home to the royal palace, where the ducal family resides in luxury and splendor.

  

The duchy of Nouvelle is divided into counties, each with its own ruling count or countess. These noble families are constantly vying for power and influence, engaging in political intrigue and warfare to gain the upper hand over their rivals. Despite their conflicts, however, the nobility of Nouvelle share a code of honor and chivalry, known as la Grande Convention , valuing courage, loyalty, martial prowess, and valuing human life above all else.

  

The people of Nouvelle are renowned for their love of wine, and the rolling vineyards that stretch for miles around the cities produce some of the finest vintages in the world. The grapes are tended by skilled vintners, who use age-old techniques to create wines that are smooth, complex, and deeply satisfying.

  

The people of Nouvelle are proud and prosperous, with a rich cultural heritage that they zealously guard. They are deeply religious, with the church playing a central role in their lives. The dominant faith is a polytheistic religion, with many gods, representing aspects of life and nature, worshiped through a hierarchy of priests and bishops. The church also maintains a network of monasteries and abbeys, which serve as centers of learning and scholarship.

  

The magic in Nouvelle is strong and palpable, and it is said that the duchess herself employs the most powerful sorceresses in the world. The ducal magic is used to protect the land from invaders and to keep her people safe. It is also used to enhance the beauty and productivity of the land.

  

Despite its beauty and wealth, Nouvelle is not without its problems. Dark forces lurk in the shadows, seeking to undermine the stability of the duchy and seize power for themselves. The ducal family maintains a network of spies and agents to counter these threats, but they cannot be everywhere at once. In the countryside, bandits and highwaymen roam freely, preying on travelers and farmers alike.

  

Despite these challenges, the people of Nouvelle remain optimistic and determined. They have a deep sense of community and loyalty to their duchy, and they will fight to protect it with every ounce of their strength. Nouvelle is a land of beauty, magic, and danger, but above all, it is a land of hope.
