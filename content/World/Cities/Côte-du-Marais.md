### Côte-du-Marais

(Coat du Ma-ray)  Translation - the swamp coast.  A large city to the south in a swamp, presumably in the shape of a bowl and hundreds of feet below sea level despite its proximity to the coast.  Opposes La Pavillon and wants control of the wine production.  Commonly called Marais.
