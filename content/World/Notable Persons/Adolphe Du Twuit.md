### Adolphe Du Twuit

Below average flour thrower in [[Petite RÃ©colte]] (piece of shit). Effectively got last place in the competition, and his pain was immortalized in the background of the town mural. His friends hate him now, and his 6 year old son told him that he wishes Herman was his father instead.
