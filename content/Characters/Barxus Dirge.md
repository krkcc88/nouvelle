Race, class, and potential subclass: Dwarf Druid

In the remote mountain range of a temperate climate, nestled among towering peaks and treacherous cliffs, lies the region of [[Vertemont]] with a rich and storied history. Over hundreds of years ago, a small group of dwarves settled in the area seeking refuge from the dangers of the outside world. Despite the rugged terrain and harsh climate, they found the mountain range to be a safe and defensible location and quickly established new communities within its rocky embrace. Through their hard work and determination, these pioneering dwarves not only survived but thrived, building a unique culture and way of life that was heavily influenced by the harsh climate and rugged terrain of the mountains. Skilled miners and craftsmen, the dwarves built their economy around the extraction of precious ores and stones from the mountains. These valuable resources became the region's major export and source of income, bringing wealth and prosperity to its people.

Despite the dangers of the mountain range, some dwarves chose to live their lives as guides, escorting traders, and travelers both between cities and through the region. Their knowledge of the terrain and their ability to navigate the treacherous landscape making them invaluable to those seeking safe passage through the mountains. However, the region's isolation and neutrality did not protect it from the conflicts of the outside world. Two neighboring kingdoms were warring over control of the wine industry that split their region. The constant fighting slowly but surely allowed bandits and monsters to inhabit the area, endangering the trade and people of the cities.

One day, while attending a community gathering in a nearby village, your character met a group of activists who were speaking out against the devastating effects of the wine industry on the local region. Intrigued by their message, your character struck up a conversation with the activists and soon found himself drawn to their cause. As he learned more about the destructive practices of the wine industry and the ways in which capitalism was driving the destruction of the natural world, your character knew he had to get involved. He joined the group of activists and quickly became one of their most dedicated and passionate members, using his skills as a guide and knowledge of the land to help plan and execute attacks on the wine industry.

However, your character also had another plan up their sleeve. They had a deep love for Kombucha, a fermented tea drink that they believed could sway the common folk away from wine. Your character began brewing Kombucha in secret, distributing it among the people and extolling its virtues as a healthier and more ethical alternative to wine. As your character continued to work towards their goal of protecting the natural world, they also worked to dismantle the capitalist system that fueled the kingdom's greed. Despite the danger and complexity of their work, your character remained committed to the cause. They continued to fight for the land and its people, knowing that the natural world was worth fighting for.

Barxus has a large family (one of six kids) of merchants providing supplies to guides and shipping goods from Vertemont throughout [[Nouvelle]].  In one of the shipping guilds.  Guides are like the calling similar to the Night’s Watch.  You devote your life to the cause despite the danger.  Barxus always looked up to the guides as they always brought in goods from around Nouvelle and idolized their sense of adventure.  He also liked the honor the guides received from Vertemont and his family in particular, having a working relationship with the guides. 

Family owns a warehouse to do import/export and a small hostel for guides to stay.  This is where Barxus idolized the guides.

Barxus is one of the younger siblings.  His younger siblings and middle ones look up to him as him being a guide.  His older siblings resent his ability to leave as they couldn’t, they have to take care of the business.
