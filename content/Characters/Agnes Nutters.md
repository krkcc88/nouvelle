Played by: Amanada

Race, class, and potential subclass: Human Cleric - Twilight Domain

Hometown: [[Lourdes]] (Lew-rrd) Logging town a couple hours away from the capital

Family: Immediate family killed by vampires. Agnes feels tremendous guilt for accidentally inviting the vampires into their home to kill her family. Agnes was rescued from the attack by a Twilight Cleric named Aziraphale.

Becoming a Cleric: After saving her life, Aziraphale brought her to the temple of Selune. Agnes feels indebted to the goddess for narrowly escaping the vampires and fully immerses herself in worship of Selune. She works as a groundskeeper at the temple to earn room & board while attending services and growing in faith. After a few years, Selune visits Agnes in a dream and informs her she has been chosen to become a cleric based on the conviction of her faith. Agnes feels a lot of dread about the duties, but follows the orders of Selune and begins training with the temple's leaders. 

Becoming an Adventurer: Agnes receives education and training as a beginning cleric from the temple, but struggles with discipline. She still feels immense guilt and intense anxiety/fear of the undead and other monsters. She develops a dependence on alcohol in her efforts to diminish those feelings. The Cleric leader, Sister Ana, determined that the best course of action for Agnes would be practice rather than theory. She pushed Agnes to venture out into the world, face her fears and face herself. Agnes reluctantly accepts the directive and leaves the temple.
